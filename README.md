# xmas_tree
The source code of my Christmas tree project based on Arduino, a RGB LED strip and a BH1750FVI light sensor. Find the full project on my website.

This code represents the software for my Christmas tree based on Arduino Pro Mini board and a RGB LED strip. It lights up automatically when the environment light goes down thanks to a BH1750FVI light sensor. In addition, a push button allows to change the light effects between a pre-defined set.
